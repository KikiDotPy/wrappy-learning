Static Google Map -> does NOT accept local files because google has to download it to render the icon on the image, does NOT accept SVG. It accept ONLY URLS that needs to be right encoded. JS map may accept SVG BUT it may be hard to make it static.

url needs url encoding, meaning that some special symbols are NOT read like | = ... so you will have to traslate it (https://developers.google.com/maps/url-encoding)

JS new Date -> you can do math with them but you will get milliseconds, if you want days you need to do the right math to transform them

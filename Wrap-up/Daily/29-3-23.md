- ***STATIC GOOGLE MAP*** / ***OOP***, I tried to follow the different files to implement longitude and latitude for each abstracted store. in a repo with thousands of file I found my way in the end but still needed to understand why the result was undefined. I also found a solution for the icon, using the url from the prod website, but still need to test it since the services where the icon is were offline today.

- ***OOP / ABSTRACTION***, thanks to the meeting with the team, I understood how much is important taking MORE time and not implementing in a rush. It's worth it spending more time researching and understanding, following the right path and abstraction instead of just partecipate in the mess of the code. I really want to learn more about patterns and abstractions

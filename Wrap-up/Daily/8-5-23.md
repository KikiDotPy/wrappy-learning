- ***GA4*** Got more context and been able to follow GA4 events with GA4 people. I helped on the meeting focus-ish

***MEETING / BUSINESS CONTEXT*** I understood that having Agenda for meeting is very useful for  the partecipants. Also I've started putting meeting notes in the card, so maybe it's easier have updates on them (especially for GA4 ones)

***PERSONAL LEARNING*** I learned a builder plugin called esbuild. A builder which other than putting together all the files needed and output them in a specific format, it provides the ability to inject code before, during or after the bundling.

***GIT*** --no-verify also skip prettyfing the file

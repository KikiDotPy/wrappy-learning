- ***STATIC MAP*** discovered it has some problem with HTTPS urls used for custom markers. It seems like it's not supporting very well the HTTPS certificate and also other certificate. Also I found out how (to style the static map)[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/styling] and I was able to delete from the map image all the point of interest that was causing a lot of noise on it. On this note, by having the url in the code more long we discovered that styling it in different lines for readibility reasons was causing issues on rendering correctly the map (when the url in the code became longer it was not working properly)

- ***ANALYSIS / AQA TOOL*** Run and analysed the accessibility results of AQA, plus did a quick manual test and a test on the browser with WAVE. I did a little pre analysis and wrote a bit of issues before the tomorrow meeting about this.

STATIC MAP -> problem with HTTPS url, the static map seems like it's not supporting very well the HTTPS certificate. You can style the map with the style attribute in a lot of different ways (documentation here https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/styling). We discovered how to delete all the Point Of Interests on the map (deleting the noises on the map)
the url have problem when using break line to make the url code more legible (when it became longer it was not working properly)

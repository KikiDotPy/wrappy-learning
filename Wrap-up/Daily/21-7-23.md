- ***DOCKER/COLIMA*** I'm kinda starting understanding how it works. It's more like a metaphorical understanding than a practical understanding but still it's a step ahead. I'm also getting familiar with some commands, so that maybe I'm starting to remember something to manage it! For istance docker exec and docker ps commands!
- ***NODE*** I decided to just start, and proceed as fast as I can. This way I can easily access the React course where I can focus more. For now the priority is really finishing 100Dev because even with just 2 articles and one video I understood what was happening in some code bases rather than when I was working on them! Also some points are connecting, so I'm pretty much satisfied
- ***CORE SKILLS*** I am starting to act more like a consultant(ish). I think it's a good way to start training the skills, and today I had the first challange with gently pushing for pair programming

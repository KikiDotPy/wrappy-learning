- ***TYPESCRIPT***, finally understood the different types of TS, included weird ones like unkown and never. Now I should have a better understanding of how to deal with the different types when using TS. The ENUM type is still a bit unclear tho.
- ***ORGANISATION***, took the initiative to organise again the TDD training!

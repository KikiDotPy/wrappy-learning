- ***NODE***, Reviewed the concepts of yesterday, especially the await/async methods and started the crash course that explained what it is (an envitoment that allows JS to run on anything else other than browsers), what it use (V8 engine like Chrome) and what are some common modules inside it (fs, http, path ... )
- ***WEBDEVELOPMENT***, I read a really interesting article about the evolution of JavaScript webdevelopment, where we explored how the package manager, the module bundler and the task manager came from and what are their use. Understood more about the different workflows I've saw in the past projects.
- ***NPM***, Saw an interesting video where we explored the npm scripts, their use and their power. I just saw it superficially but I want to deep dive and take notes with time. Maybe writing something about it!

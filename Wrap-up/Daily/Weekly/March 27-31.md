**HIGHLIGHT MARCH 27 TO 31**

- ***STATIC GOOGLE MAP***, discovered how to implement a static map and which API was better to use for it. Also read the documentation and discovered different things on how to personalise the map, for istance the custom marker was a challange because it has limitations (for example no svg, only url etc...)
- ***AQA***, we had a training with UsableNet to explore better the tool and now I understood better how to take advantage of the tool, for example how to use the extenction and how to test single components.
- ***JS DATE***, you can do math with dates but you will always get milliseconds.
- ***A11Y***, You can give structure and highlight sections of the page to give the Screen Reader user the ability to easily navigate and review the whole page by simply adding **VISUALLY HIDDEN HEADINGS**. 
- ***OOP / ABSTRACTION***, thanks to the meeting with the team, I understood how much is important taking MORE time and not implementing in a rush. It's worth it spending more time researching and understanding, following the right path and abstraction instead of just partecipate in the mess of the code. I really want to learn more about patterns and abstractions

- ***Feedback***, don't worry about the technical stuff (you can always learn them). Keep focus on the agile practices and always keep in mind the WHY and HOW of the broad picture. ASK MORE WHYs and HOWs. 

 -> it's good that everyone ask about my thoughts on accessibility, I'm building trust.

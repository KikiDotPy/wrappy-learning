- ***BACKEND***, finally got to Node and made it clearer what's the purpose of backend and what is Node.js
- ***JS PROMISES***, took a while, but finally I think I have clear what are Promises and how to use the async/await sugar syntax of the promises. Did a lot of review as well as discovered new stuff about them (or at least made some concept clearer)

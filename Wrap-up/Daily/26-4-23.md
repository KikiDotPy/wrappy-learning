- ***G. SERVICE*** PBL works as 'cash in store'

- ***JAVASCRIPT*** reviewed the regex. Learned the right mental model in 'reading code' is from right to left (especially when it comes to variable or storing data). Also understood more about the difference between assignment and mutation in JavaScript: When we reassign a variable we don't change the data we change the bucket, when we use const we are binding a specific bucket to a variable but we can still change what's inside the bucket! So when we change what's inside the bucket it's **MUTATION** while when we connect a variable to a bucket it's called **ASSIGNMENT** const doesn't block mutation, but only assignment

- ***VIM*** Learned a bit more about it and learn some more commands on it. I understand the power but it feels still complicated. The command to show the syntax is awesome, even though I am already not able to do it again. 
- ***TDD*** I think I've just realised why is important writing tests first. First of all they let you understand what will be the outcome we want but they also give us the opportunity to be more secuer when doing changes. Indeed now, without tests, I'm having quite some problems with the new components
- ***COMMUNITY*** I'm trying to keep up with the dev open space and started to make announcements and also making sure to go on with the review of the survey and why is it so hard to partecipate to communities.

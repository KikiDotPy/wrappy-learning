- ***JAVASCRIPT*** We can use Object.Assign() in the constructor when creating classes to assign the properties more easily. The static keyword for functions is used to NOT be directly accessed on instances of the class. Instead, they're accessed on the class itself.
    
    
    constructor(firstName = 'John', lastName = 'Doe', age = 0, gender = 'Male') {
      Object.assign(this, { firstName, lastName, age, gender });
    }

- ***CORPORATIVE*** Need to develop social skills/networking and find ways to make it sustainable.

- ***JENKINS / PIPELINE*** Today I look a bit more throuly on how the deployment works when there are many repos. Basically the package.json is for dependencies and the jankins file is where the deployment is managed. For components usually you need to release the version and then update the version in the enviroment.

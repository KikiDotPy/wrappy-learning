- ***QUBIT*** discovered the tool, which is like Optimizely and it's used for A/B testing

- ***ANALYSIS / ACCESSIBILITY*** Understood more how to drive an analysis of a11y manual issues. It has been more clear and straightforward including also the prioritisation! Also talked about the dev responsability and how is not good be picky only on technicality when it comes to accessibility, because for a website being accessible means more than just have the right semantic. Also a11y users should be like ALL USERS, and not treated like an exeption

- ***JAVASCRIPT*** reviewed the sort function

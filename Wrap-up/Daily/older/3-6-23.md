- ***ACCESSIBILITY*** Reviewed the implementation of a side-step menu, keeping in mind the a11y. I discovered that the Voiceover has an issue when it comes to aria-disabled which is not working properly on both list and anchor elements. It is not said outloud by voiceover while on NDVA works properly with the right implementation without workaround.

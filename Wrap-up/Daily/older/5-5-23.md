- ***GA4*** Got more context and been able to follow GA4 events with GA4 people

***MEETING / BUSINESS CONTEXT*** I understood that taking notes it's very crucial to better understand what's going on during meeting and for later reference. Try to have more context on stuff and take more notes

***PERSONAL LEARNING*** I'm in a pretty good shape to be a consultat, I want to have some double check with J. and M. then probably I will need to work a bit more on my technical expertise. Try to ask this in the next catch up.

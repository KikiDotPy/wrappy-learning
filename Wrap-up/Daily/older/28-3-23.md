- ***STATIC GOOGLE MAP***, it does NOT accept local image files in folders because google has to download it to render the icon on the image, it does NOT accept SVG. **As custom marker it accept ONLY URLS that needs to be right encoded**. JS map API may accept SVG BUT it may be hard to make it static. url needs url encoding, meaning that some special symbols are NOT read (symbol like | = +) so you will have to traslate it [documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/url-encoding)
- ***JS DATE***, you can do math with dates but you will always get milliseconds. If you needs other kind of time, like days, seconds, minutes, you will need to transform them with the right math (just search for it)
- ***A11Y***, You can give structure and highlight sections of the page to give the Screen Reader user the ability to easily navigate and review the whole page by simply adding **VISUALLY HIDDEN HEADINGS**. WAI aria tools change how elements are translated into accessibility tree NOT their behaviour OR presentation. SKIP LINKS are hidden links with IDs that go to specific section of the page to allow Screen Reader users to skip specific section and navigate to the next one (example -> you have a list of item lazy loading, you can have a skip link to allow the user to go to the next step) 
- ***AQA***, we had a training with UsableNet to explore better the tool and now I understood better how to take advantage of the tool, by doing component testing, user journey testing both automated and manual!

- ***PACKAGE MANAGERS, NPM*** I've finally understood their purposes and "kinda" their use! It's everything a bit clear of what I've use and saw in the past 6 months, plus I'm starting looking and understanding both the configuration and the fuss about front-end having so much frameworks.
- ***CORE SKILLS*** Today I mostly focus on organising our work, find kind of a plan and populate what was missing from kickoff! I'm pretty proud because I felt it was a practice of a mix of my planning/analytical skills plus a bit of consulting!

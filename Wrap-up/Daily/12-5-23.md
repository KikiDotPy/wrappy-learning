- ***JAVASCRIPT*** We can use Object.Assign() in the constructor when creating classes to assign the properties more easily. The static keyword for functions is used to NOT be directly accessed on instances of the class. Instead, they're accessed on the class itself.
    
    
    constructor(firstName = 'John', lastName = 'Doe', age = 0, gender = 'Male') {
      Object.assign(this, { firstName, lastName, age, gender });
    }

- ***CORPORATIVE*** Need to develop social skills/networking and find ways to make it sustainable.

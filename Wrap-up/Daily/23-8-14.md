- ***LIBRARIES***, understood more about Sonar and Rollup libraries thanks to coworker. Rollup is a bundler and Sonar is used for Clean code and security checks
- ***SAST vs DAST***, learned about SAST and DAST (Static Application Security Testing (SAST) vs Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)). They are used for security check and suggestions and code review. The difference between SAST and DAST is that the first one access the source code while the second one not, DAST is a form of closed box testing, which stimulates an outside attacker's perspective.
- ***DBeaver***, finally used DBeaver and start to make a bit of practice with it. Made a new DB and managed some roles permissions
- ***BACKEND*** , had a glimpse of backend using swagger and understanding what are annotations in Java. Probably need a lot more experience when it comes to response, request and API.
- ***PROJECT EXPERIENCE***, got a bit more practice and context in the project we are in. Slowly I'm trying to grasp how to handle things but also to understand the broader picture
- ***REACT TOSTIFY***, learned about this library that handle errors! Easy and clean interface

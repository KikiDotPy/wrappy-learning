- ***POSTGRESQL*** tried to lookup the database and the command to execute. Started to slowly understand even tho the overall setup seems super long
- ***DOCKER/COLIMA*** same as the database, I started to have a first approach (alone) and trying ot understand things and what they do. I know a few more commands that I hope they will stick with me. I also kinda understand the difference between colima and docker (ish)

- ***GA4*** I challanged myself writing the tests for the event we migrate yesterday, it took 30minutes and I understood more than usual! I also learned that taking time with the line of code is never time bad spent

- ***KNOWELEDGE SHARING*** First time I've been a reference for something! I've been able to explain how to do a task and the context

***TYPESCRIPT*** Learned a bit more the grammar of the language, ish.

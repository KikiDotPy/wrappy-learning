- ***TDD***, understood that writing and having tests not only avoids me feeling anxious but they also help me develop the feature more simply and easily
- ***JEST***, slowing having experience with the jest feature and understanding how to do things with it
- ***BACKEND***, understood how to run gradle and maven, the tabs on the left are surely useful. I also understood how to link local repositories in local with maven (pushighing the needed repo using pushingMaven feature in the maven tab on the left)

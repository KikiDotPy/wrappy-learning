- ***LIBRARIES***, explored and implemented husky library to our ui library. It was a nice experience and let me understood how to read json and how to adapt scripts. I'm slowly learning the structure and practices when it comes to big projects
- ***CORE SKILL***, partecipating and supporting with ideas and questions, I'm trying at my best to make it an habit as much as I can!
- ***PRESENTING***, did the start performance meeting and I was very pleased by how I've organised it, it seemed more structured and people attending seemed lees lost. Also I've received good feedback and I love to keep things happy and funny. Need to practice more this with lightweight vibes
- ***JENKINS*** , started to understand how to handler a Jenkins file and it was easier than it seemed a while ago! I'm pretty satisfied to at least don't feel panic but curiosity

- ***TDD***, paired with the senior and had the chance to understand better **how to base the creation of tests on code** and how to write tests using React
- ***LIBRARIES***, slowing understanding how to set up a library to be reused in other components, the index indeed doesn't need to render something **but** to export the components and the types you've created in the code. This way it will be reusable as a module
- ***NPM***, understanding a bit more how to set up the package.json and installing and managing dependencies. Discovered **peer dependencies** and keeping the package.json more tidy.
- ***ESLINT/PRETTIER***, discovered a bit more about their use and other modules like husky and rollup. I've finally also understood how to run tests when you commit and also run the formattin (all thanks to husky)

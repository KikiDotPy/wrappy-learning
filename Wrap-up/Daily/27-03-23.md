- ***STATIC GOOGLE MAP***, In an attempt to implement a map for the collect in store option in the website, we realized google maps static have a 403 problem when used with React (?) but we found a workaround using the result URL from the API request to get around this issue. We worked on setting up the right parameters and researched how to implement a custom marker on the map. This is possible, but we'll need to use images, not svgs. We got stuck on the implementation of svg, this reminds me to do more promptly the right questions to avoid rabbit holes!
